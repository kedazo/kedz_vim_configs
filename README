 The other parts (tags and syntax files) which are made by me

 * tags/*.tags
 * after/syntax/cpp/*.vim

 No garranty, warranty... etc. the usual stuff.

Dependencies:
 * Some latest VIM version
 * ctags

Info:
 This repository contains basically my ~/.vim directory, and also
 my vimrc, if you clone this move this to your home as well and make
 a symlink like this: ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc to turn on the magic.
 (!!!XXX!!! Please don't forget to make a backup 
  from your previously used vim configuration first!)

 After you done, go to your project directory, press Ctrl+F12 it will generate
 tags file for your project, and when you enter '.' or '->' in the code
 the autocompletion will pop-up, and the Qt4 and LMT based code will be 
 (hopefully) properly syntax highlighted...

PS:
 Any ideas, patches...etc are welcome, feel free to send me an e-mail.
